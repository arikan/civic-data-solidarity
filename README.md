## Civic Data Solidarity 

Increasingly, a new generation of civil society initiatives is generating data on issues from human rights violations to Internet governance, from labor crimes to environmental justice. However, although many of the issues are interrelated, the data generated by separate civil society organizations, civic data, are rarely used in relation to one another.

This project aims to build a protocol to make civic data interoperable across civil society projects and tools. By doing so, it aspires to weave new networks and contribute to solidarity among the civil society organizations.

The project will employ workshops with experts from civil society initiatives; facilitate discussion of ideas, tradeoffs, and needs to bring isolated data types together; review other existing solutions; and distill the information into diagrams and schemes, and develop the first version of a protocol for civic data solidarity.


## Terms

**Data**: Measurements, recordings, or observed facts generated about human or nonhuman activities.

**Data subject**: The ones or things that are being tracked.

**Data generator**: The ones who are doing the tracking.

**Civic data**: Data generated about civil society issues where the data subject is not citizens or consumers, but companies, governments, and systems.

**Solidarity**: A social principle that produces unities of interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies. Solidarity is maintained through the interdependence and interoperation of its constituents.

**Communication Protocol**: A system of rules that allow multiple entities of a communications system to transmit information. The protocol defines the rules syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol)

**Protocol for civic data solidarity**: A schema for structuring data about civil society issues in order to facilitate data interoperation among civil society projects and tools.
