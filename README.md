Increasingly, a new generation of civil society initiatives is generating data on issues from human rights violations to Internet governance, from labor crimes to environmental justice. However, although many of the issues are interrelated, the data generated by separate civil society organizations, civic data, are rarely used in relation to one another.

This project aims to build a protocol to make civic data interoperable across civil society projects and tools. By doing so, it aspires to weave new networks and contribute to solidarity among the civil society organizations.

The project will employ workshops with experts from civil society initiatives; facilitate discussion of ideas, tradeoffs, and needs to bring isolated data types together; review other existing solutions; and distill the information into diagrams and schemes, and develop the first version of a protocol for civic data solidarity.
